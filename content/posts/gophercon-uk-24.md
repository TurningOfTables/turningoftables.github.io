I recently had the chance to attend GopherCon UK 2024! What think? <!--more-->

### Thinks:

The annual GopherCon in London hosts around 500 people over several days, including a number of talks on topics specific to Go as well as coding in general - most are technical but some are more career focussed, and perhaps unsurprisingly a number of talks this year related to AI's role in programming.

In my former life as a tester I'd attended some different events which followed a similar pattern but with a QA focus. Although there were nuggets of useful information, they were often overtaken by sponsors and businesses attempting to sell test software and qualifications of varying usefulness

This would be my first 'coding' conference, and it was refreshingly different. 

The focus was on different challenges, approaches and current topics in the world of Go. The talks were not thinly veiled attempts to sell products, but by engineers sharing knowledge based on their own experiences. They felt honest, and relatable.

I don't plan on writing up each talk in detail from my notes here, but highlights included:

- a fascinating keynote on why engineering is much more of a human pursuit than it appears (and thus why AI will not replace all parts of it).
