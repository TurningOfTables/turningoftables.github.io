I recently had the chance to attend GopherCon UK 2024. What think? <!--more-->

### Thinks:

The annual GopherCon in London hosts around 500 people over several days. It features a number of talks on topics specific to Go as well as coding in general. Most are technical but some are more career focussed, and perhaps unsurprisingly a number of talks this year related to AI's role in programming.

In my former life as a tester I'd attended some different events which followed a similar pattern but with a QA focus. Although there were nuggets of useful information, they were often overtaken by sponsors and businesses attempting to sell test software and qualifications of varying usefulness.

This would be my first 'coding' conference, and it was refreshingly different. 

The focus was on different challenges, approaches and current topics in the world of Go. The talks were not thinly veiled attempts to sell products, but by engineers sharing knowledge based on their own experiences. They felt more honest, and relatable.

I don't plan on writing up each one in detail here, but highlights included:

- a fascinating keynote on why engineering is much more of a human pursuit than it appears (and thus why AI will not replace all parts of it).
- a talk on some challenges and potential pitfalls of serverless functions (so that I'm scared of it now).
- a guided path through several stages of debugging and logging (so that I realise what we need to aim for at work).
- a demonstration of the abilities of the Pact contract testing tool (which makes me want to try it on a small scale).
- a run-down of costs and benefits in SPA and SSR for front end apps (that lead me to read more on the templ package).
- a presentation showing some approaches for tackling entropy and chaos in software projects, and why you can embrace it (and now I feel better about organising things badly)
- some thoughts on Impostor Syndrome; rather than fearing it, we can actually embrace it to make ourselves better engineers (which is good because I have plenty to go around!)
- A lovely soft Gopher plush (hug)
- Lots of free sweets (eat)


On a much more human level, I gained an increase in confidence. Since I've not long moved into pure software development from testing, I am regularly asking myself the classic Impostor question of 'Do I belong?' and 'Am I just faking it well enough to get by?'.

Attending the talks and being able to understand the challenges being faced, consider how the knowledge can be applied to my own problems, and even being able to _read and understand the code_ made a world of difference to feeling that I am acclimatising to the world of software coding.

Alongside this, it gave me a great chance to have longer and more detailed conversations with engineers I work alongside every day, but without the background pressure of having to push on with a specific task at hand. We ranged over the talks that we'd seen and how we felt about them, as well as diving a bit more deeply into some of our current goals with work projects and brainstorming ways forward. It felt like a rare opportunity that's hard to recreate on video calls or in short burst breakouts during larger gatherings, and I really enjoyed the experience.

Overall, my first GopherCon was tremendously positive. I came away feeling energised (mentally), tired (mentally and physically) but boosted in confidence and with a lot of new ideas or tools to follow up on in the coming weeks.
