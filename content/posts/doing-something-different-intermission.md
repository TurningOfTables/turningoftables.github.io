A brief diversion to talk about confidence and Impostor Syndrome<!--more-->

Doing what I'm trying to do - move away from an area where I have significant experience, and shift focus into new territory - is scary.

I feel I have reached a point where I have done so much software testing that I can always use that experience to solve new problems, do different types of testing and create a good plan of attack for the majority of test requirements. 
Or if not, I can at least eloquently and confidently complain about them. My knowledge is wide enough and my library of previous challenges deep enough to feel fairly sure of myself.

Trying to improve my coding ability outside of automated test writing, however, has shown me where the edges of my confidence lie.

The main thing that crosses my mind is "Am I good enough to do this?"

Many experienced developers at all levels up to and including principal and CTO have told me I am, but it's still a little hard to get over the feeling that I'm lacking something. I can write code, it does the things I want it to do ‚Ä¶ so what am I missing?

This is of course the classic experience of [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), and I half expected it to happen when I made this shift. In fact, its presence is probably not remarkable in itself.

### Coding, Transparency and Impostor Syndrome

I think coding and programming in particular are skills that encourage that feeling - perhaps more so than other job roles. My experience of software development often treats coders as a somewhat 'special' role, with boundaries drawn between 'tech' and 'non-tech' roles. I might be going a little far here, but people with less experience of coding often seem to see it as akin to magic. Many times I've seen a Product Owner make a request of developers; the developers go away and huddle around a cauldron in private, stir it a little and then declare whether the request can or cannot be completed and in what timeframe. I rarely see that response challenged or questioned, or even any digging for an explanation. On the one hand I absolutely agree that coding restrictions or difficulties _can_ be difficult to explain (although I believe the best engineers are the best explainers), but a lack of transparency is allowed between coding and non-coding roles which I suspect would be less acceptable in other interactions.

I will add that I'm not only throwing shade at engineers or tech roles here. I think this goes both ways. In the same way we would expect tech roles to interact with and update work tracking tools so that everyone can see progress, I think there are also lessons to be learned for non-tech roles too. You do not have to become an expert, but it can pay big dividends to have a conceptual understanding of coding. Not only does this allow you to challenge engineering decisions more effectively, but it can also help simply in terms of communication across that imaginary tech/non-tech boundary. Be [T-Shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).

My switch of focus from manual to automated testing - now many years ago - and subsequent experience reading the code that actually runs decent size websites, has taught me that coding isn't magic. It can be hard, and has a learning curve, and sometimes requires maths (!), but it's also logical once you dare to look. It's sometimes surprising to compare the perception you have of people both before and after you read their actual code, even with my background as an automation tester rather than focussed developer. 

And yet here I am, still wondering if I am missing some secret sauce or huge wealth of knowledge that all developers secretly have.

If you have any of that secret sauce please send it to me.

Seriously, I'll pay.
