One of the most damaging elements of traditional software development culture has been a strict allocation of duties between disciplines.

"The designer draws some pictures and describes some functionality, the developers write code to make those pictures, the testers check that it works as expected."

That might work where projects aren't especially time constrained, and the business is comfortable making slow progress. Apply it to fast moving web development though and it causes numerous issues. Now that time is more constrained, testing is the one area which can be squeezed which doesn't have an instant effect on release dates. The feedback loop of poor quality is delayed and thus often not identified, thus encouraging more squeezing of test resources.

So what approaches can be taken to address this, which are within reach of most assertive testers?

One is to grow a culture which makes testing and quality a mindset, rather than a function. Instead of testing being a step in the process, it should undertaken as part of _every_ step in the process.

* While a feature is being designed, engage the team to 'beat up' the proposed solution early and identify assumptions or avoid potholes. Testers can shine here by spotting potential issues or identifying scenarios which haven't been considered.

* During development, give coders a clear responsibility of testing their own work thoroughly before it is regarded as being complete. Just as any professional would be expected to check their work, coders should do the same. Testers can be engaged to pair with programmers for fast test-fix loops.

* Bring product owners into the testing process as soon as possible during development to ensure that the requirements they had are being met.

* Recruit the wider company as sources of feedback where possible - new eyes and lack of familiarity with the feature under development can be an excellent source of bugs and improvements.

By doing this you accomplish a number of improvements throughout the software delivery process for both you as the tester and quality itself. More issues both in approach and execution are found earlier in the process, where they are cheaper to fix. By the time we reach the business end of a feature or release, the peak of testing and development effort has passed and the move to production is more predictable as a result.
