				<p>A Go app to show nearby planes</p>
<h3 id="the-initial-idea">The initial idea</h3>
<p>Actually it wasn&rsquo;t really my idea. I came across another implementation of a planespotting app in JavaScript using the OpenSky API and thought, &ldquo;I will do that but in Go&rdquo;. Then I did a bit more searching and it turns out there are tons of these.</p>
<p>Undaunted, I wanted to make it anyway because it combines two things that I like: planes and Go.</p>
<p>I had some idea of the basic requirements up front:</p>
<ul>
<li>be able to specify a location you&rsquo;re at</li>
<li>be able to specify a radius in which you want to be notified about planes</li>
<li>send an OS notification when a plane was &lsquo;spotted&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, I knew that this was likely to grow a little as I had ideas during development - and it did a little!</p>
<h3 id="writing-iterating-refactoring">Writing, Iterating, Refactoring</h3>
<p>After initially writing the basic functionality above without too much trouble, I added on a couple of neat (at least to me!) features. The first was the ability to feed config in from outside the app, so you didn&rsquo;t have to specify it each time and it would be easier to set up for other users. The second was saving &lsquo;progress&rsquo; of some sort - this culminated in a list of the flight numbers and a total of how many planes you&rsquo;ve spotted. Keeping a list of flight numbers also prevented the same plane being constantly &lsquo;spotted&rsquo; as it stayed in the area nearby; especially obvious if your location is set at or near an airport.</p>
<p>Once I had these in place, I decided the app was getting big enough to need a bit of splitting out. I created sub-folders with packages of &lsquo;helpers&rsquo; for everything outside <code>main.go</code>. So I had <code>helpers/save/save.go</code> and <code>helpers/config/config.go</code> and <code>helpers/formatters/formatters.go</code> etc., each with their own tests such as <code>helpers/save/save_test.go</code></p>
<p>This worked just fine, and in fact I rather liked splitting the code into &lsquo;systems&rsquo;.</p>
<h3 id="adding-the-ui">Adding the UI</h3>
<p>What happened next was I decided I wanted to add a UI, and this proved harder than expected. I used the <a href="https://fyne.io/">Fyne</a> and found it to be simple to pick up and create functional and decent looking APIs. However it was tricky to integrate into my previously written (and structured code).</p>
<p>The UI needs to run from main - all good so far. The UI also needed to interact with other areas of functionality in the helpers - again, no problem. However the helpers <em>also</em> needed to access back into main in order to update the UI on changes such as status, or saves, which was hard to do - going back <em>up</em> the tree, as it were.</p>
<p>So what did I do in the end? I moved much of the code back out of their own sub-folder packages, and instead just split it into files in the root of the project as part of the main package. So <code>helpers/save/save.go</code> with <code>package save</code> became <code>/save.go</code> with <code>package main</code>.</p>
<p>This allowed easier access between the different sections of the apps, while I kept packages that didn&rsquo;t need to push info back into the UI in <code>helpers/</code> (namely, the <code>formatters</code>). Overall I did solve the problems, although it required significantly more work than I expected.</p>
<p>On reflection, my mindset was probably used to building an API which can then be universally consumed by a front end client. In this case though, since I hadn&rsquo;t really built an &lsquo;API&rsquo; to be &lsquo;universally consumed&rsquo;, when it came to adding a consumer it was tough going.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-would-do-differently">What I would do differently</h3>
<p>There are two main lessons I can take from this about how I write more code into projects.</p>
<p>#1</p>
<p>My code needs to have more cleanly defined boundaries, and be written to be consumed cleanly and more agnostically. Different functionalities should be better split out. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concerns</a></p>
<p>In general this was less of an issue in my smaller earlier projects, but the larger they get the more this becomes something I need to manage better.</p>
<p>#2</p>
<p>Clearly I will never know all of the requirements and features of a project before even starting to write it. However, adding in the UI was a fairly major turn - I think if I&rsquo;d decided on this significant part earlier on then it would have saved a significant amount of pain later. I should try and decide on the <em>large</em> pillars or requirements before starting, even if additional smaller items are added in later.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This was a super useful project in that I had to confront a few things I hadn&rsquo;t done before. I got deeper into configuration, saving and retrieving files, and also dabbled into creating my first basic UI with the Fyne framework.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also fairly pleased with the end result in terms of functionality. The code would certainly benefit from a little more tidying and documentation, but a user can run the binary, enter their details and be getting planespotting notifications in just a couple of minutes. ðŸŽ‰</p>
