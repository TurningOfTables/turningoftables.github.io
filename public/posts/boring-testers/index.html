			<h1>Boring Testers</h1>

				<p>Testing really doesn&rsquo;t have to be boring. There is a certain subset of testers that just make me want to quit testing though.</p>
<p>Primarily they have a background working in large companies with significantly sized test teams. The processes are static and unchallenged, the testers themselves are passive and often subservient. They appear to wait for work to come their way, and expect it to be a rote set of checks to follow. Get the ticket, test the ticket, get the ticket, test the ticket.</p>
<p>In some cases they are automation testers - usually using Selenium and Java because that&rsquo;s what the developers use or because they learned a bit in the 90s and haven&rsquo;t tried to improve themselves or change things since then.</p>
<p>Often during these interviews there&rsquo;s no evidence of any kind of proactive thought about what is being tested and why. &ldquo;It is the way it is because that&rsquo;s the way it always has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like that.</p>
<p>The majority of inputs into a software project are often made up of people who hold their main motive as delivery. Business requirements, sales, project owners, designers, engineers. Not many roles are in a good position to act as a counterbalance and challenge assumptions, but testers are.</p>
<p>When you start thinking about testing instead of passively accepting work, it opens up an entire world of possibilities which have the eventual result of producing a better quality product - not just one that ticks boxes that business requirements have determined are important.</p>
<p>You can think about whether the feature being proposed or developed is well conceived and is likely to succeed based on actual data, not just a hunch or common sense. You can discuss testing outside of functional and narrow business-led acceptance criteria; consider performance, accessibility and user experience. As a tester with hopefully domain knowledge, you are in a superb position to help the team explore unknown risks and how to mitigate them.</p>
<p>What sets great testers apart from average testers is their attitude. Great testers are proactive, questioning and want to control their own work. They want to own the testing and take responsibility for the project&rsquo;s quality. They act as an opposing force when project delivery pressures arrive or when developers try to rush work through. And most critically of all, they <strong>think</strong> about what they&rsquo;re doing. This is where testing gets interesting.</p>
