				<p>A little exploration of small scale function mocking for Go testing</p>
<p>Function mocking is an area I hadn&rsquo;t really dipped into very much until recently. My main mocking experience has been verbal and network based, using tools like <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a>, <a href="http://www.mbtest.org/">Mountebank</a> and the like.</p>
<p>The concept is similar of course, except instead of mocking network responses or requests you&rsquo;re mocking functions.</p>
<p>What took a little bit of thinking through was where the mocks actually need to &lsquo;be&rsquo;. Like network mocks (mostly), you don&rsquo;t really want to call your mocks directly from the tests, because that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything. You set up mocks and then call the function under test. The function under test then makes onward calls which is where the mocks get hit.</p>
<p>Here it is represented badly with arrows: <code>Test &lt;-&gt; function under test &lt;-&gt; mocked function calls</code></p>
<p>Your test then asserts that it gets the expected result and, as a bonus with many mocking libraries available, you can assert that the expected function calls were carried out to your mocks.</p>
<p>Where this comes together really nicely in Go is with interfaces. Because interfaces in Go are implicitly satisfied when a type implements all the methods defined by an interface, it&rsquo;s easy to &lsquo;slide in&rsquo; your mock functions instead of the real thing during test setup.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have the following very contrived example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// main.go
package main

import &#34;time&#34;

type TimeHelper interface {
	Get() string
}

type Time struct{}

func (l *Time) Get() string {
	t := time.Now().String()
	return t
}
</code></pre><p>Pretty simple. A type of Time with a method of Get() that returns the current time. This satisfies the interface TimeHelper.</p>
<p>You have the below code which creates an instance of Time and calls your function &lsquo;getMeTheTime&rsquo;:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// time.go
package main

import (
	&#34;fmt&#34;
)

func main() {
	res := GetMeTheTime(&amp;Time{})
	fmt.Println(res)
}

func GetMeTheTime(sh TimeHelper) string {
	return sh.Get()
}
</code></pre><p>If you create a regular test, you&rsquo;ll always get back a different result depending on what time it is, which is a pain to test for. Instead, we can create a mock type which satisfies the TimeHelper interface, but with a Get method that always returns whatever you give it</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// time_mock.go
package main

type MockTime struct{}

// Always returns what is provided as a string
func (ml *MockTime) Get(input string) string {
	return input
}
</code></pre><p>Then in our test, we can write the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// main_test.go

package main

import (
	&#34;testing&#34;
)

func TestGetMeTheTime(t *testing.T) {
	mock := MockTime{}
	expected := &#34;2000-01-01 01:01:01.000000001 +0000 UTC&#34;

	res := GetMeTheTime(&amp;mock)

	if res != expected {
		t.Errorf(&#34;expected: %v, got: %v&#34;, expected, res)
	}
}
</code></pre><p>So my terrible diagram with more specific names could now look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>TestGetMeTheTime &lt;-&gt; 
GetMeTheTime(passing a mock that implements the expected interface param) &lt;-&gt; 
MockTime&#39;s version of Get() is called, which always returns a static time that we can test for
</code></pre><p>This is an extremely bare bones implementation as I experiment with the idea and make it go into my brain, but hopefully it gets the pattern across reasonably well.</p>
<p>Creating mocks at a larger scale would likely benefit from the use of a library for generating reliable mock methods and allow asserting that method calls were actually made. It&rsquo;s beyond the scope of this post but very popular are several libraries which will generate sets of mock methods for a given interface. Two I&rsquo;ve come across so far are <a href="https://github.com/vektra/mockery">mockery</a> and Uber&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/uber-go/mock">mock</a> which is a fork of the original <a href="https://github.com/golang/mock">mock</a>, now archived.</p>
