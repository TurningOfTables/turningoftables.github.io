				<p>A little earlier this year I decided that I wanted to try something different.</p>
<p>At that point I&rsquo;d been testing software for around 15 years across games and web e-commerce and I found myself doing the same things over and over again. The faces change, the CSS gets fancier, the automation frameworks rise and fall, and JavaScript bundles grow, but the routines were pretty familiar.</p>
<p>After too long where I&rsquo;d stare of a window (especially when it was raining for pathetic fallacy bonus points) and wonder if I really wanted to be fighting the same unwinnable battles for the rest of my career, I became frustrated enough to leave my current position without a new job lined up - or even an exact career.</p>
<p>I was going to take a bit of time out and see if I could rediscover some enjoyment, perhaps in other areas of software development.</p>
<p>My plan was reasonably simple - I wouldn&rsquo;t work for a while, and I&rsquo;d use that time to explore learning into different areas. If I liked one of these areas I&rsquo;d invest time into developing my skills and a portfolio of work then try and apply for some jobs. If I didn&rsquo;t like any or it didn&rsquo;t work out, I felt I had the option to return to testing work in a fresh environment and with a rested, better outlook.</p>
<p>So what were my areas I was going to explore?</p>
<p>Short answer: Games, Coding, Pen Testing.</p>
<p>Long answer:</p>
<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lifelong games player. They formed a large part of my childhood, lead to my first permanent job and have continued to be something I love to do in a slightly obsessive way. I also know a lot of games players and a few people who work at different games studios or as independent developers, so I had a little insight into the games development process.</p>
<p>One possible direction then, was games development - and my plan was to create one or two reasonably simple prototypes using the Godot games engine for a few weeks at a time to go through part of the design and implementation process. I had an idea for one of them already, which was an interesting experience for a future post.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed coding and engineering approaches to solve problems during my work. One of the biggest breaks in my career to date has been to pick up and specialise in automated web testing. It lead me into coding, helped me get jobs and set me apart from some other testers. I&rsquo;d also created a number of small websites for friends to support their independent games releases in the past, and enjoyed it.</p>
<p>For coding my plan was a little more specific. Instead of piecemeal picking up random parts of a language as and when I needed it. I feel this leads to quite patchy and uneven knowledge, as there&rsquo;s a tendency to solve all problems with what you know rather than what&rsquo;s available - something about everything being a nail when all you have is a hammer. So I was going to learn Go from a book - The Go Programming Language (Alan A. A. Donovan, Brian W. Kernighan, 2016), supplemented of course by online resources as the book was a few years old. Then I was going to create some example coding projects to support future job applications.</p>
<h3 id="pen-testing">Pen Testing</h3>
<p>This leads perhaps more off from the testing than the automation part of my experience, although of course automated pen testing is certainly a thing. This is probably a slightly left field choice but arose from my enjoyment of unofficially poking about through systems at previous jobs and occasionally turning up some quite serious security problems which could then be addressed.</p>
<p>My motivation here I think is partly that security issues are more complex and taken more seriously than visual or even functional test issues, so the stakes are higher and the task significantly more engaging.</p>
<p>I was kindly given a few pen testing books over the last year or two, so my plan was to follow those through. For reference the books were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Penetration Testing, Georgia Weidman, 2014</li>
<li>Linux Basics for Hackers, OccupyTheWeb, 2019</li>
<li>The Pentester Blueprint: Starting A Career As An Ethical Hacker, Phillip L. Wylie, Kim Crawley, 2021</li>
<li>Hacking APIs, Corey J. Ball, 2022</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So that was my plan. It was scary to be honest, and people kept using the word &lsquo;brave&rsquo; when I told them I was going to stop working for a while, which was even scarier.</p>
<p>More posts will be added to talk about how each of my explorations went.</p>
