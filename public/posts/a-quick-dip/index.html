			<h1 class="post-title">A Quick Dip Into Svelte</h1>
			<time datetime="2023-09">09.2023</time>

				<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to try making something using Svelte about fourteen times now</p>
<p>, but never quite had any inspiration on exactly what to make. Thankfully
a friend of mine helped out; he wanted a way to track the holiday he booked from work, and found the provided tool hard to use.</p>
<p>After around 4 total days of work time, I had an application using Svelte, SvelteKit and TailwindCSS with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration, with user password bcrypt encrypted</li>
<li>Login/logout</li>
<li>Set and display used and total amount of annual allowance</li>
<li>Add, display and delete holidays</li>
<li>Add, display and delete excluded holiday periods</li>
<li>Historical holidays are marked to indicate they have already been taken</li>
<li>Calculate days used as business days, ignoring weekends</li>
<li>Validation prevents overlapping holidays or excluded holiday periods, holidays which end before they start etc.</li>
<li>Data storage in SQLite DB</li>
<li>Basic browser tests with Playwright</li>
<li>Unit tests for date utils using Vitest</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-was-it">How Was It?</h3>
<p>Initially it was a little bit strange having to confirm to quite an opinionated structure for the project in SvelteKit. Using the <code>+page</code> file naming took a while to get used to, but as I progressed and was adding more features
into the structure already created, it started to become quite natural. I don&rsquo;t know if this is strictly the best way to think about it, but mentally <code>+page.svelte</code> became a view to me, and <code>+page.server.js</code> effectively became a controller.</p>
<p>Structurally, common actions like adding a new button to interact with my SQLite data store, displaying data back into the user&rsquo;s page, applying my own logic or conversions to that data, even adding authentication were relatively simple within SvelteKit. I was able to put the code
in a place that felt right, and pass data between different concerns with confidence.</p>
<p>Svelte itself does a good job of allowing you not to worry too much about keeping the DOM up to date, and inserting basic logic into what to display. I found passing props around and understanding what data was available where to be much simpler than with React, and the lifecycles of a component were less of a worry, as was state management. Some of the syntax feels a little bit strange (<code>$: yourVariable</code> for example), but the tutorial explains it well and it quickly becomes second nature. Despite bouncing off React a few times, I found
I was able to get into Svelte more easily, produce what I wanted, and not fight the tech but work with it.</p>
<p>Overall it was a good experience, and when I look at the features that I was able to implement in less than a full work week it&rsquo;s clear that it was a very productive set of tools to work with.</p>
<h3 id="would-you-do-it-again">Would you do it again?</h3>
<p>Maybe! I have to say that my main reservation was not to do with Svelte, SvelteKit or TailwindCSS. It was that I missed writing code in Go. JavaScript felt a little bit vague and uncertain by comparison, and I missed having a simple and clear
set of tools to solve problems with. That being said I did appreciate the JS ecosystem when working with things like dates (using <code>date-fns</code>), which made some quite fiddly checks for different date-related things much easier.</p>
<p>To be honest I&rsquo;ve missed Go though so I&rsquo;m going back to that next. I&rsquo;ve been linked a good looking framework called beego that definitely seems worth a look</p>
