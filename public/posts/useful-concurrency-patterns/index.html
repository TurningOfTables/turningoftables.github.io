			<h1 class="post-title">A Useful Go Concurrency Pattern - WaitGroups and Buffered Channels</h1>
			<time datetime="2024-01">01.2024</time>
			<div>
				<p>While improving my knowledge of how Go implements concurrency, and various ways of handling it, I came across some useful common patterns which I found helpful as a baseline to build in.</p>
<p>I split my requirements for concurrency into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to safely spin out work into multiple &lsquo;workers&rsquo; that improves overall execution time.</li>
<li>The ability to limit or throttle the number of workers that can be active at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The below example implements both of these, using two features of Go. WaitGroups, and buffered channels.</p>
<h3 id="waitgroups">WaitGroups</h3>
<p>WaitGroups are designed to allow you to wait for more than one goroutine to complete before your program exits. Without a WaitGroup or equivalent functionality your program will exit before your goroutines have a chance to do their work. It essentially works by incrementing a counter for each goroutine, and decrementing it when it completes. Then you wait until the counter is 0 to know all goroutines are done.</p>
<p>To use them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an instance of WaitGroup</li>
<li>Each time you spin up a goroutine, call <code>Add(1)</code> on your WaitGroup</li>
<li>Within your goroutine, call <code>Done()</code> when its work is complete. This is usually done with <code>defer</code> to ensure it executes</li>
<li>In your <code>main()</code> function, call <code>Wait()</code> to block until all workers are complete.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="buffered-channels">Buffered Channels</h3>
<p>Sometimes called a semaphore approach, this works by using a buffered channel set to the size of the maximum concurrent workers you want to allow. When a worker begins work, it &rsquo;takes&rsquo; a slot by sending a value to the buffered channel. Once the worker is complete it &lsquo;gives back&rsquo; the slot by receiving a value from the buffered channel.</p>
<p>If the buffered channel reaches its capacity as more workers take slots, it will block until the channel has capacity, effectively limiting the number of concurrent workers.</p>
<p>To use them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a buffered channel that is the size of the maximum concurrency you want to allow. It&rsquo;s common to make it a channel that accepts type struct{}, e.g <code>c := make(chan struct{}, 5)</code> - in this case we want our max concurrency to be 5.</li>
<li>When a worker begins work, take up a slot by sending to the channel <code>c &lt;- struct{}{}</code></li>
<li>When a worker completes work, give back the slot by receiving from the channel <code>&lt;- c</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-complete-example">A Complete Example</h3>
<p>The below example uses the <a href="https://httpbin.org/">httpbin.org</a> service for API requests, and implements a random delay to make the jobs take a variable amount of time.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>package main

import (
	&#34;fmt&#34;
	&#34;math/rand&#34;
	&#34;net/http&#34;
	&#34;sync&#34;
	&#34;time&#34;
)

var maxConcurrency = 2 // the most number of workers we want to allow
var jobs = 4 // how many jobs there are to be done

func main() {
	fmt.Printf(&#34;Starting %d jobs (max concurrent: %d)\n&#34;, jobs, maxConcurrency)
	startTime := time.Now()
	c := make(chan struct{}, maxConcurrency) // create our buffered channel so we can limit workers
	var wg sync.WaitGroup // create our WaitGroup instance

	for x := 1; x &lt;= jobs; x++ {
		wg.Add(1) // register our worker
		go doWork(x, c, &amp;wg) // start our worker
	}

	wg.Wait() // wait for number of registered workers to be 0
	fmt.Printf(&#34;All jobs complete in %v&#34;, time.Since(startTime))
}

func doWork(x int, c chan struct{}, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done() // ensure that the WaitGroup counter is decremented when the function returns
	startTime := time.Now()
	c &lt;- struct{}{} // Take a slot from the buffered channel
	queueTime := time.Since(startTime)

	artificialDelay := rand.Intn(3)
	url := fmt.Sprintf(&#34;https://httpbin.org/delay/%d&#34;, artificialDelay)
	http.Get(url)
	fmt.Printf(&#34;Completed job %d in %v  (queue time %v)\n&#34;, x, time.Since(startTime), queueTime)

	&lt;-c // Give back the slot to the buffered channel
}
</code></pre><p>Running the above gives us output similar to the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Starting 4 jobs (max concurrent: 2)
Completed job 1 in 404.0926ms  (queue time 0s)
Completed job 4 in 1.4033671s  (queue time 0s)
Completed job 2 in 1.5535537s  (queue time 406.1108ms)
Completed job 3 in 2.6434148s  (queue time 1.4061137s)
All jobs complete in 2.6518036s
</code></pre><p>As we can see, we have two jobs that started immediately (with no queue time), and two jobs that had to wait because our maximum concurrency was two.</p>
