				<p>Making lots of small decisions that are suboptimal but only affect a small amount of your user base is deceptively damaging over time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s commonplace to be faced with the following following choice during development:</p>
<p>a) Do something quick and easy to implement, but which knowingly annoys a tiny proportion of your users.</p>
<p>b) Do something slower and harder to implement, but which makes your users happy.</p>
<p>Generally the resulting decision in my experience has been a), and I can initially understand why. It allows you to keep things moving forward, and it appears to have a very small cost.</p>
<p>However, beware of making these decisions over and over again and seeing them as individual choices rather than cumulative.</p>
<p>Your first decision of a) annoys 0.5% of your users (for example). Who cares! It&rsquo;s an edge case that you can&rsquo;t spend your time worrying about. There are bigger fish to fry.</p>
<p>You then forget about it in the next release, and make another a) decision in a different feature. +0.5% annoyed users.</p>
<p>You then forget about it in the next release, and make another a) decision in a different feature. +0.5% annoyed users.</p>
<p>You then forget about it in the next release, and make another a) decision in a different feature. +0.5% annoyed users.</p>

<p>You then forget about it in the next release, and make another a) decision in a different feature. +0.5% annoyed users.</p>
<p>Now 5% of your users are annoyed. Decisions like this go on and on, without any view of their cumulative effects on the overall project. Of course these numbers are all illustrative - the groups of annoyed users might overlap, and you might be gaining more happy users with your new features than you are annoying with your compromises.</p>
<p>Far be it from me to suggest that compromises aren&rsquo;t sometimes required, and in fact I&rsquo;m a strong believer in the idea that the perfect (software) is the enemy of the good (software) - but be very keenly aware that while you may be making different decisions on disparate features, they don&rsquo;t disappear in the next release - they accumulate.</p>
